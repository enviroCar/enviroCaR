As we can see, the attribute contains id (point nr) and time (still as factor, not as POSIXt) and the measured values are still in a JSON string that needs to be parsed. For this, we wrote an import function that converts time, parses the JSON into measured value, and adds a units attribute to the sp object:
<<>>=
importEnviroCar = function(file) {
    require(rjson)  # fromJSON
    require(maptools)  # spCbind
    # read data as spatial object:
    layer = readOGR(file, layer = "OGRGeoJSON")
    # convert time from text to POSIXct:
    layer$time = as.POSIXct(layer$time, format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    # the third column is JSON, we want it in a table (data.frame) form: 1. form
    # a list of lists
    l1 = lapply(as.character(layer[[3]]), fromJSON)
    # 2. parse the $value elements in the sublist:
    l2 = lapply(l1, function(x) as.data.frame(lapply(x, function(X) X$value)))
    # bind these value elements, row by row, together
    ret = do.call(rbind, l2)
    # read the units:
    units = lapply(l1[1], function(x) as.data.frame(lapply(x, function(X) X$unit)))
    # add a units attribute to layer
    layer[[3]] = NULL
    # add the table as attributes to the spatial object
    if (length(layer) == nrow(ret)) {
        layer = spCbind(layer, ret)
        attr(layer, "units") = units[[1]]
        layer
    } else NULL
}

\subsection*{Interpolating a point sequence}
Here, we interpolate the point measurements to a new set of points, using inverse distance weighting

<<>>=
n = length(sp) * 5  # create 5 points between each observation...
cc = coordinates(sp)
newx = approx(cc[, 1], n = n)$y  # along x,
newy = approx(cc[, 2], n = n)$y  # along y,
crs = CRS(proj4string(sp))
newpts = SpatialPoints(cbind(newx, newy), crs)
# Alternatively: convert to SpatialLines, then use spsample
library(gstat)
# interpolate Consumption values:
idw = idw(Consumption ~ 1, sp, newpts)
@
We can plot this sequence by

<<>>=
spplot(idw[1], colorkey = TRUE, scales = list(draw = TRUE), main = "inverse distance interpolated Fuel Consumption values")
@
Here, the new points are evenly distributed between all existing points, meaning that with 5 times as much points, between every two points 4 points are added equidistant. This gives a new point density that resembles the original point density.

Alternatively, we could generate interpolation points globally equispaced (e.g. by using spsample over a line, type = “regular”) equidistant in time, by taking time of measurement into account
\subsection*{Aggregation of trajectory data: spatial}
We can aggregate to a 5 x 5 grid, using an arbitray aggregation function, here max
<<>>=
bb = bbox(sp)
grd = GridTopology(bb[, 1], apply(bb, 1, diff)/5, c(5, 5))
sp.agg = aggregate(sp[-1], SpatialGrid(grd, crs), max)
@
and show the results, for 

<<>>=
spplot(sp.agg[-c(1, 2, 8)], colorkey = TRUE, sp.layout = list("sp.points", sp, 
    col = 3), main = "maximum measured value per grid cell")
@
\subsection*{Aggregation: temporal }
When looking at temporal variability, we see that for this trajectory the values are very unequally distrubed, indicating a break in the trajectory

<<>>=
plot(y = sp$Consumption, x = sp$time)
title("Fuel consumption over time")
@
We can also aggregate to time intervals, e.g. 10 min values. For this, we will convert the points to a zoo object (time series)

<<>>=
library(zoo)
@


<<>>=
xx = zoo(sp$Consumption, sp$time)
plot(aggregate(xx, cut(sp$time, "5 min"), mean))
points(xx)
title("10-minute mean Consumption (l/h)")
@
After having played with spatial objects (package sp) and temporal objects (package zoo), we can convert these data into spatio-temporal objects (package spacetime):

<<>>=
library(spacetime)
stidf = STIDF(geometry(sp), sp$time, sp@data)
stplot(geometry(stidf), main = "trajectory points, cut in 6 time slices with equal amount of points")
@
plots the geometry of the spatial points, over time, cutting time in six parts with an equal number of observations.


Trajectory data can be represented as Track object,
<<>>=
track = Track(stidf)
tracks = Tracks(list(tr1 = track))
tracksCollection = TracksCollection(list(tr = tracks))
stplot(tracksCollection)
@

The next plot adds attribute values as colour, 
<<>>=
stplot(tracksCollection, attr = "speed", lwd = 3, scales = list(draw = T))
@

\subsection*{Adding a background map}
Using package ggmap, we can add a google map background (or other background):

<<>>=
bb = matrix(NA, 2, 2)
bb[2, ] = c(51.94, 51.985)
bb[1, ] = c(7.58, 7.67)
library(ggmap)
@


<<>>=
map4ao <- get_map(location = as.vector(bb))
@


<<>>=
# maptype = 'satellite', scale=2, zoom=4) Read the attributes to pass them
# to grid.raster
bbMap <- attr(map4ao, "bb")
latCenter <- with(bbMap, ll.lat + ur.lat)/2
lonCenter <- with(bbMap, ll.lon + ur.lon)/2
height <- with(bbMap, ur.lat - ll.lat)
width <- with(bbMap, ur.lon - ll.lon)
## Another component of the sp.layout in spplot
sp.raster <- list("grid.raster", map4ao, x = lonCenter, y = latCenter, width = width, 
    height = height, default.units = "native")
stplot(tracksCollection, scales = list(draw = TRUE), sp.layout = sp.raster, 
    col = "red", lwd = 2, main = "google map background")
@

The following code allows conversion from SpatialPoints into SpatialLines, and has been added to sp:

<<>>=
setAs("SpatialPoints", "Line", function(from) Line(coordinates(from)))
setAs("SpatialPoints", "Lines", function(from) Lines(as(from, "Line"), "ID"))
setAs("SpatialPoints", "SpatialLines", function(from) SpatialLines(list(as(from, 
    "Lines")), from@proj4string))
@
\subsection*{Generalizing a trajectory}
We can generalize a trajectory using Douglas-Peuker by using gSimplify in rgeos:
<<>>=
sl = as(sp, "SpatialLines")
library(rgeos)
@

<<>>=
plot(gSimplify(sl, 5e-04), axes = TRUE)  # WRONG: rgeos takes lat/long as Euclidian coords
plot(sp, add = T, col = "red")
title("generalization in Long/Lat (wrong!)")
@
however, without warning this falsely assumes that coordinates are metric, i.e. in a Euclidian system. They are not:
<<>>=
proj4string(sp)
@
How can we resolve this?
\section*{Reprojecting data to UTM}
Package rgdal contains code to reproject data:
<<>>=
library(rgdal)
utm = CRS("+proj=utm +zone=32 +north +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
slT = spTransform(sl, utm)
5e-04 * 110000  # approximate meters per degree latitude
@

<<>>=
plot(gSimplify(slT, 55), axes = TRUE)  # RIGHT: rgeos takes coords Euclidian
plot(spTransform(sp, utm), add = T, col = "red")
title("generalization in UTM zone 32N")
@
A plot of the (projected) simplified trajectory, here represented by a set of selected points, is created by 1. conversion to lines, 2. simplifying the line, 3. conversion to points, 4. matching to the full set of points, and 5. selection:

<<>>=
sl.simplified = gSimplify(slT, 55)  # 2
sp.simplified = as(sl.simplified, "SpatialPoints")  # 3
sp = spTransform(sp, utm)
sel = zerodist2(sp.simplified, sp, 0.001)[, 2]  # 4
sp.selected = sp[sel, ]  # 5
length(sp.selected)
@

<<>>=
sp.selected[1:3, ]
@

<<>>=
spplot(sp.selected, "Consumption", colorkey = TRUE, main = "selected points according to Douglas-Peuker")
@
\subsection*{Further problems regarding generalization}
Generalization as done above only retains the spatial path, but ignores time and attributes. One could rather easily implement Douglas-Peuker on higher-dimensional curves e.g. (x,y,t) or (x,y,t,Attr1,Attr2,...,Attrn) but then one needs a distance metric that combines space, time and attributes – which one would be good?
\subsection*{What have we learned?}

\item{1} Reading trajectory data is tricky: some trajectories have no attributes for part of the points, some have a different number of attributes; this make joining them difficult (but not impossible)
\item{2}   Subsampling, or generalizing the trajectories is easy if we only focus on space (Douglas-Peuker, rgeos::gSimplify), but needs difficult choices if time and/or attributes are taken into account too
\item{3} Densifying by interpolation is easy, but one needs to choose where to put extra points: equally spaced between observation points, equally distributed over space, equally distributed over time?
\item {4} Aggregating trajectory data leads to change of support: new values are now valid for a grid cell, or a polyline, and for a time interval; we haven't addressed colouring

\subsection*{Open questions}
\item{1} Should R take care of the heterogeneity in the data served, or should the data served be consistent?
\item{2} How do we aggregate over multiple trajectories, e.g. when they have different sampling rates? Simply take the points, or weight by interval length or duration?
\item{3} How do we assign trajectories to road segments?
\item{4} How do we aggregate over space AND time, and how do we visualize this?
\item{5} How do we analyze (e.g., summarize) trajectories, within drivers and between drivers?}
\item{6} How do we compare trajectories, how do we compare drivers?
